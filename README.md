This file showcases the updated Selenium commands, which have changed from the moment of filming my <a href="https://youtu.be/iJGvYBH9mcY" target="_blank">YouTube tutorial</a> and now.
<br>
FYI, in the new version of Selenium, commands of this syntax:

```driver.find_elements_by_tag_name("input")```

were replaced with commands of that syntax:

```driver.find_elements(By.TAG_NAME, "input")```
